# school_workforce_analytics

  :PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze teachers’ monthly and yearly attendance. Transformed raw Excel data into visual reports showing KPIs, trends, teacher-wise comparisons, and distribution. Enabled administrators to track absenteeism patterns and make data-driven decisions.

  :TECH STACK:
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for dashboard design and interactivity.
• 📂 Excel – Data storage and preparation of monthly attendance records.
• 🧮 Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation for reporting.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures (e.g., % attendance, averages).
• 📝 Data Modeling – Linking teacher details with attendance tables for cross-filtering.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix (dashboard), .xlsx (raw dataset)

  :DATA SOURCE:
The dataset for this project was prepared from the School Teachers’ Attendance Register, which is maintained in Microsoft Excel. It captures the day-to-day presence and absence records of teachers across the academic year.
The attendance records are categorized as follows:
  > Present (P): Number of working days a teacher was present.
  > Absent (Ab): Number of days leave was taken with prior sanction.
  > Leave (L): Officially declared gazetted holidays, summer vacation, or winter vacation.

  :FEATURE/HIGHLIGHTS:
• Business Problem
School management often struggles with tracking teachers’ attendance manually. Identifying consistent absentees, spotting seasonal dips, or summarizing yearly attendance is time-consuming without a data-driven tool.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To provide an interactive attendance monitoring system that:
  > Summarizes monthly & yearly teacher attendance.
  > Enables comparison across teachers.
  > Helps administrators take quick, informed decisions regarding workforce management.
